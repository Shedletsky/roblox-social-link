# roblox-social-link

Adds a first-class “Roblox” service to the Social Icons block in WordPress. See it live on [Shedletsky.com](https://shedletsky.com/).

I had some problems styling the editor widget icon in WordPress, so I hacked around it in a gross way. If you know how to fix it, please send a pull request.
